# The Obviois Life Datapack  
Welcome to Yet *Another* Life Series Datapack - This one was created with primary goal of customization. Currently implements functionality for Third and Last Life, with eventual plans for Double Life implementation.

## Features
 - Toggleable boogeyman
 - Customizable starting number of lives, including a randomizer from 2-7 lives
 - Individually toggleable custom recipes
 - Individually toggleable mob spawn egg drops
 - User-friendly text menus for settings and implemented functions
 - QoL functions such as manual life addition & subtraction and boogey picking & curing

## Recipes
All recipes can be individually disabled or enabled.
- Saddles can be crafted shapeless with three leather
- Nametags can be crafted shapeless with one string and one paper
- TNT can be crafted with paper in the corners instead of gunpowder (one gunpowder, four paper, and four sand)

## Mob spawn eggs
Mobs have a 5% chance to drop their spawn egg when killed by a player. All drops can be individually enabled or disabled, and currently include the following mobs:

- Blazes, breeze, cave spiders, creepers, drowned, endermen, skeletons, slimes, spiders, witches, and zombies.

## Compatibility
- Datapacks that modify mob drop loot tables for any of the above mobs may break the spawn egg dropping mechanic and are currently untested.

README markdown was made easier for me using [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)

This was my first crack at making a datapack with limited pre-existing experience. My immense gratitude to the below invaluable resources for making this entire process easier for me, and I highly recommend them. Those that put the energy, time, and knowledge into these tools and resources are frequently in the background yet contribute so much, and everyone who contributed to these resources made dipping my toes in both easier and clearer to navigate.

These unofficial [command](https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/24addfd65c82cb38009b5c34bfa2c188) and [datapack mcfunction](https://gist.github.com/VideoCarp/eeaf915a2361d93f0fd8cf2c72d6db64) documentation guides by VideoCarp was maybe the most helpful beginner guide I found to Minecraft commands and datapack mcfunctions.

[r/MinecraftCommands' resources page](https://minecraftcommands.github.io/wiki/resources) and assorted threads were super helpful to me - the page includes a ton of helpful tools and resources including the ones below.

[Misode's Datapack Generator](https://misode.github.io/) was used to generate the loot tables for custom mob drops, custom recipes, and the datapack's pack.mcmeta, but it can do a ton more that I didn't end up needing.

[GamerGeeks'](https://www.gamergeeks.net/apps/minecraft/tellraw-command-generator) /tellraw and /title generator was used to facilitate generating essentially all the text you see in this datapack.
